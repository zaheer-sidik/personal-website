    <p>Here are a list of some projects I have worked on in my free time and during internships, (hopefully more to come):</p>
        <div>If you have any questions about any of these projects feel free to <a href="mailto:zaheersidik11@gmail.com">contact me</a>!</div>

                  <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.2em;"><a href="https://zaheer-sidik.github.io/Sprint-Time-Predictor/" target="_blank">Sprint Training Time Predictor</a> - Winter 2025</h2>
                    <div>I developed a website that takes in a user's PB for a given distance and then predicts PBs at other distances and training times - currently used by the coaches at my athletics club. 
                      <strong>It is based on data from Sprints and Relays by Dick, Frank W (1987).</strong></div>
                    <div><strong>Skills Developed:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, Web Design</div>

                    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.2em;">PML Language Extension - Summer 2025</h2>
                    <div>PML is AVEVA's proprietary language that is used in E3D. During my internship at AVEVA I worked on adding features such as 'go to definition' and hover functionality which allows users to easily navigate throughout codebases.
                         I also implemented virtual documents to display information on in-built objects and gadgets. Furthermore, I helped implement go to references for variables and methods and code snippets.</div>
                    <div><strong>Skills Developed:</strong> VSCode Extension Architecture, Typescript</div>

                    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.2em;">Cultured Chicken Production Group Research Project - 2024 to 2025</h2>

                    <div>I worked as part of a group to design a plant with the capability of producing 1 tonne of meat per year. I specifically worked on the differentiation stage, focusing on the bioreactor design for the myogenesis and adipogenesis processes.
                         I used ASPEN Plus to model the heat generated within these bioreactors and then used this to design the reactor thickness and jacket sizing. Furthermore, I also worked on the overall material and energy balance for the entire plant. We were also tasked with looking at the financial viability of the plant.
                          To do this I used the overall material and energy balance to come up with the overall CapEx and OpEx. I also performed an optimisation to determine where the plant should be situated and considered supply chain strategy, which involved looking at key suppliers, sensitivity to supply chain disruption and which relationships to prioritise.</div>

                    <h2 style = "margin-bottom: 0.2em;">Sustainable Computing - Winter 2024</h2>
                    <a href="files/B1_Sustainable_Computing.pdf" target="_blank" style="margin-top: 0;">View the Report</a>
                    <div>I worked on a project that would take carbon intensity data from the UK and use models to predict future emissions, on the hourly, daily, monthly and yearly timescale.
                         In this project I used Facebook's Prophet model as well as LightGBM. I also used PowerTOP to measure the power consumption of two different laptops when running these models. The findings of this project were used to inform users when the best time to run computationally intensive tasks would be in order to minimise carbon emissions.</div>

                    <h2>Liquid Nitrogen Heatsink CFD - Summer 2024</h2>
                    <div>During my internship at the University of Oxford, I worked on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) project focused on optimising a liquid nitrogen heatsink for power electronics applications. 
                        This involved creating the heatsink geometry in SolidWorks, and then simulating the fluid flow and heat transfer in ANSYS Fluent. The goal was to inform the purchasing of a heatsink for experimental testing, through parametric studies and optimisations.</div>
                    <div><strong>Skills Developed:</strong> CFD Simulation, ANSYS Fluent, SolidWorks</div>
